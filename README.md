# githubAPI

Github API is a site that allows the user to enter the name of a Github user and see basic information about them including 
number of repos
who they are following
who is following them
and a list of projects they have worked on

To use this site you will need to a github API key and create a file called ".env" in the top level of the directory, with this:

exports.apiKey = "API-KEY-GOES-HERE";

You can get a github API key from the "Settings" page of your account, and click "Personal access tokens". With access to a key, you can run this site by typing "gulp serve" at the top of the directory in bash.
